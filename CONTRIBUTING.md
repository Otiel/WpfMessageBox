# How to contribute with a pull request

## Workflow

This repository follows [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) as a git branching and release management workflow. In short, after having forked the repository, you need to:

* Checkout a new branch from the `develop` branch, named either `feature-…` or `fix-…`:

      git checkout -b fix-cover-not-downloaded develop

* Commit your changes to the new branch.
* When done, create a new pull request to your new branch.

## Commits

Please follow the [commit message conventions](/docs/commits-conventions.md).
